---
## 1. `guard pre`

Runs the Pre-Task Guard phase before modifying code.

```bash
guard pre "<prompt>" [options]
```

### Arguments:
* `prompt` (required): Natural language description of the task about to be performed.

### Options:
* `-r, --repo <path>`: Target repository directory (default: current directory).
* `-q, --quick`: Accepted for compatibility; has no effect since the triage was removed in 0.11.
* `-s, --scope <path|dir|glob>` (repeatable): Declare the files the task may change. Files named in the prompt are added automatically; globs are accepted only here. On Windows prefer a directory (`--scope src/ui`) over a quoted glob.
* `--allow-dirty`: Start although files are already modified. They are snapshotted (`git stash create`, working tree untouched) and reported as pre-existing; post reviews only the edits made after pre.
* `--force`: Restart an unfinished or rejected session. The restart keeps its baseline, snapshot, base commit, scope and locked invariants, is listed in the reports, and scope added by it fails as `SCOPE-004`.

Pre refuses to start on a dirty tree (without `--allow-dirty`) and over an unfinished or rejected session (without `--force`).

---

## 2. `guard post`

Runs the Post-Task Guard verification phase after code has been edited.

```bash
guard post [options]
```

### Options:
* `-r, --repo <path>`: Target repository directory.
* `-f, --focus <area>`: Quality pillar to focus scrutiny on (`all`, `security`, `memory`, `performance`, `ux`, `dead-code`, `simplicity`). Default: `all`.
* `--auto-fix`: Trigger self-healing remediation suggestions if verification fails.
* `--hook`: Git-hook mode. Skips when the repository has no guard session; with an approved session, passes only when the changes match what was approved.

Post audits against the base commit recorded at pre, runs the build command, invariant checks and the removed-symbol reference check, then asks the LLM. A new or edited `guard.invariants.json` is self-checked on the current tree; a declared edit that removes or changes rules shows them as RETIRED / re-evaluated and reports `INV-WEAKENED` (MEDIUM), an undeclared one blocks (CRITICAL). Rules the LLM discovers are written, after validation, into the local `.guard/invariants.json` (never into the repository's file).

---

## 3. `guard run`

Executes the automated Sandwich Pattern around any command.

```bash
guard run "<prompt>" -- <command...>
```

Accepts the same pre-task options: `--scope`, `--allow-dirty`, `--force`.

### Example:
```bash
guard run "Add customer discount calculation" --scope src/pricing -- git status
```

---

## 4. `guard review`

Performs an on-demand review of the current Git working tree diff using your configured LLM.

```bash
guard review [options]
```

### Options:
* `-r, --repo <path>`: Target repository directory.
* `-f, --focus <area>`: Quality pillar focus (`all`, `security`, `memory`, `performance`, `ux`, `dead-code`, `simplicity`).

---

## 5. `guard config`

Manages configuration for LLM providers and Alibaba OCR sync.

```bash
# View active configuration table:
guard config

# Launch interactive configuration wizard:
guard config llm [--local]

# Test LLM connection with token-free latency ping:
guard config test

# Manually synchronize credentials to Alibaba OCR CLI:
guard config sync
```

---

## 6. `guard install` / `guard uninstall`

```bash
guard install                          # global: hooks for every repo + directives in installed agents' global files
guard install --workspace <dir>        # workspace: directives in <dir>/CLAUDE.md and AGENT.md + hooks in its repos
guard uninstall [--workspace <dir>]    # remove the marked directive blocks and guard's hooks
```

Global writes the marked guard block into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` and `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, only for agents whose config directory exists; existing content is kept and backed up once (`*.guard.bak`). Uninstall removes only the marked block (deleting a file that held nothing else) and unsets `core.hooksPath` only when it points at guard's hooks.

---

## 7. `guard hook`

Manages Git hooks, AI Agent directives, and multi-repo workspace protection. `guard hook install` without options runs `guard install`; its options keep the previous per-repository behavior.

After `guard install`, every repository is set up automatically the first time guard runs in it, without creating any repository diff: the local, Git-excluded `.guard/invariants.json` is created when the repository has no invariants, and a guard hook is added only when Git runs hooks from inside `.git`. Hooks kept in the repository tree (e.g. `.husky/`) and repository agent docs are never edited; `guard doctor` shows what to change. `guard hook refresh` rewrites what guard installed earlier to the current version; the same refresh runs once automatically after each upgrade.

```bash
guard hook install          # same as `guard install` when used without options
guard hook refresh          # refresh global hooks, guard hooks inside .git and marked blocks in global agent docs

# Workspace / Multi-Repo Mode (auto-discovers child Git repositories):
# Interactive menu: [A] All repos, [1-N] specific repos (e.g. 2,3,7,8), [G] Global, [N] None
guard hook install --all-repos              # Install Git hooks to all discovered child repos
guard hook install --select-repos "1,2"     # Selectively install to specific child repos

# Global Git Protection (Protects EVERY repository on your machine automatically):
guard hook install --global                 # Sets git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.guard/hooks

# Legacy per-repository modes:
guard hook install --stealth                # 👻 Git hook in .git/hooks only (no repository file changes)
guard hook install --mode agent             # 🤖 Agent directives appended to the repository's CLAUDE.md & AGENT.md (you asked for it: this is a repository change)
guard hook install --mode all               # 🛡️ Both of the above

# Check active status of hooks, child repositories, and global hooks:
guard hook status

# Safely uninstall hooks and restore previous user files:
guard hook uninstall [--mode <git|agent|all>] [--global]
```

### Options for `guard hook install`:
* `-r, --repo <path>`: Target repository or workspace directory.
* `-m, --mode <git|agent|all>`: Installation mode (`git`, `agent`, `all`).
* `-s, --stealth`: Shortcut for `--mode git` (Git hooks only, no `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENT.md`).
* `-g, --global`: Configure Git hooks globally for all repositories via `git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.guard/hooks`.
* `--all-repos`: Automatically install Git hooks into all discovered child Git repositories in workspace mode.
* `--select-repos <indices|names>`: Comma-separated list of child repo numbers (e.g. `2,3,7,8`) or folder names.

Every install mode creates the local `.guard/invariants.json` when the repository has no invariants (see `guard invariants init`) and never overwrites an existing file. Where guard appends directives it keeps the existing content, adds a marked block and makes a one-time `.guard.bak` backup.
---

## 8. `guard invariants`

Create and validate project invariants: the local, Git-excluded `.guard/invariants.json` (guard's) and the optional `guard.invariants.json` in the repository root (yours, committed; a rule there wins over a local rule with the same id).

```bash
# Create the local, Git-excluded .guard/invariants.json; imports numbered items under an "Invariants" (or Vietnamese "Bất biến") heading of AGENT.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md:
guard invariants init

# Create guard.invariants.json in the repository root instead, to commit for the team:
guard invariants init --shared

# Evaluate every check on the current code, without a session (exit 1: a check fails, exit 2: file missing or invalid):
guard invariants check
```

---

## 9. `guard reset`

Close the current guard session, for example after its work was committed or abandoned. The session is archived to `.guard/history/<session_id>.json`.

```bash
guard reset
```

---

## 10. `guard update`

Safely updates Alibaba OCR respecting the 3-day supply-chain quarantine cooling period.

```bash
# Check update status without installing:
guard update --check

# Safely upgrade Alibaba OCR (halts if release is < 3 days old):
guard update

# Explicitly bypass quarantine hold:
guard update --force

# Upgrade Banh-Mi-Guard CLI itself from GitHub:
guard update self

# Check for Guard CLI updates on GitHub without installing:
guard update self --check
```

After a successful `guard update self`, the new version runs `guard hook refresh` automatically (global hooks, guard hooks inside `.git` of recorded repositories, marked blocks in global agent docs) and prints the setup check. An upgrade done outside guard is refreshed by the first guard command of the new version.

---

## 11. `guard doctor`

Runs comprehensive system environment diagnostics and audits latest releases for both Banh-Mi-Guard CLI (GitHub) and Alibaba OCR (npm).

It also prints the **Installation & Repository Setup** table for the current folder: Git hooks, agent directives (global and in this folder/repository, including sections without guard markers), the repository's own `core.hooksPath`, `guard.invariants.json` and leftover files from older versions. Every missing item comes with the command that fixes it (`guard install`, `guard hook refresh`, `guard invariants init`). The same check runs after `guard update self` and once on the first command of a new version, showing only the problems.

```bash
guard doctor [options]
```

### Options:
* `--updates / --no-updates`: Toggle npm registry update checking (default: on).
* `-q, --quarantine-days <float>`: Cooling period in days (default: 3.0 days).

---

## 12. `guard laya` (removed)

Removed in 0.11. The Laya neural triage only produced informational guesses and never influenced a gate decision; the repository domain is detected from the repository itself. `guard laya ...` prints this notice, and old model files in `~/.guard/models` can be deleted.
