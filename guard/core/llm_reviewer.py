"""
LLM Reviewer Engine — The Final Safety Gate.
Uses the LLM configured by the user (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.)
to act as the Senior Architect & Code Reviewer:
1. Reads the aggregated verification report (diff summary, build status, OCR rules, invariant checks)
2. Evaluates Technical Soundness (architectural integrity, memory leaks, security, out-of-scope files)
3. Evaluates Ergonomics & UX/UI Polish
4. Issues Final Score (0-10) and Verdict: APPROVED or REVISE with Actionable Remediation.
Supports selective focus mode: `security`, `memory`, `performance`, `ux`, `all`.

If no LLM API key is configured, falls back to deterministic local heuristic evaluation.
